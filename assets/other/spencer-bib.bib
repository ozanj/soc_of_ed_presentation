	Abstract = {Building on coherence theory and a pragmatist tradition, we offer an inductive model of top-down theorizing that can be a source of new theories of organization. We explain how an initial hypothesis is refined to enhance its potential contribution (consistent with abduction). But, unlike abduction, we explain how inquiry begins\&{\#}x2014;how research tensions are carved out of the flux of the vast literature\&{\#}x2014;and how constant comparison facilitates an abductive process.},

@techreport{RN4550,
	Abstract = {We study two interventions in Texas that were designed to overcome multiple hurdles faced by low-income, high-ability college students. The Longhorn Opportunity Scholars (LOS) and Century Scholars (CS) programs recruited at specified low-income high schools, provided additional financial aid, and enhanced support services once enrolled in college if students attended University of Texas-Austin or Texas A\&M-College Station, respectively. These flagship institutions are widely regarded as the top public universities in Texas. Using administrative data that links K-12, postsecondary, and earnings records for Texas public college students, we find via difference-in-differences estimates that the LOS program had a large, positive effect on high-achievers: attendance at UT-Austin increased by 2.2 percentage points (81{\%}), and the likelihood of graduating from UT-Austin increased by 1.7 percentage points (87{\%}). Twelve or more years post-high school, earnings of those exposed to LOS rose by 4.0{\%}. These results entirely come from women, who saw enrollment at UT-Austin increase by 4.0 percentage points, graduation from UT-Austin increase by 2.6 percentage points and earnings increase by 6.1{\%}. We find no evidence that the CS program affected any postsecondary or labor market outcomes. These results indicate that targeted recruitment combined with adequate supports and financial aid can substantially increase enrollment of low-income students in higher quality colleges and improve labor market outcomes. However, the differences in the LOS and CS program effects highlight the importance of understanding how to design these programs to maximize their impact on students.},

@book{RN4548,
	Abstract = {This book explores the philosophical underpinnings, history, and key elements of each of five qualitative inquiry approaches: narrative research, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, and case study. Using an accesible and engaing writing style, author John W. Creswell compares theoretical frameworks, ways to employ standards of quality, and strategies for writing introductions to studies, collecting data, analyzing data, writing a narrative, and verifying results. New to the Second Edition: Brings the philosophical and theoretical orientations to the beginning of the book: This grounds students in the foundational thinking behind these methods much earlier. Gives broader coverage of narrative research: One of the original five approaches is expanded from "Biography" to "Narrative," thus exploring a wider range of narrative opportunities, biography still being one of them. Offers a much deeper discussion of interpretive approaches: there is much more emphasis on interpretive and postmodern perspectives such as feminism, ethnic and racism, and critical theory. Provides more specific steps for doing research within each approach: the actual procedure for each approach is discussed and includes the sub-types of qualitative research within each of the five approaches. Illustrates phenomenology and ethnography: two new, recent sample journal articles: one covering a phenomenological study; the other on an ethnographic study are included. Includes additional examples: More examples from the human services add to the robust examples in education, sociology, and psychology already present in the text. Intended Audience: this is an excellent text for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses in introductory qualitative research methods across the social, behavioral, and health sciences. {$[$}Ed.{$]$}},

Based on a course that the author taught for 7 years at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, it is written in an informal, jargon-free style and incorporates many examples and hands-on exercises. Rather than the rigid, linear approach to design that is usually found in research methods textbooks--and which is particularly ill suited for qualitative research--this book presents a flexible, systemic model of design.
