# Motivation
## The problem with policy discourse about college access

The 2014 White House "Access Summit" 
- `r citet(bib['RN4016'])` review of causes of unequal college access
    - Highlights "achievement gap", "under-matching"
- *Commitments to Action on College Opportunity*  `r citep(bib['RN4017'])`
    - Universities pledge "action plans" (e.g., holistic admission, need-based aid, "outreach")

Problem with policy discourse
- Place responsibility on students, K-12 schools; assume universities are passive or progressive

<br>
Alternative explanation for access inequality
- University enrollment priorities biased against poor students and/or communities of color

Research focus (this paper)
- We argue recruiting behavior is an indicator of enrollment preferences
- **Research question**: What are the similarities and differences in off-campus recruiting patterns across public research universities?

# Background
## The enrollment management industry

*** =left

**The enrollment funnel**

<img src="assets/img/New-Admissions-Funnel.png" alt="Enrollment Funnel" style="width:80%;float:left;">

*** =right

**Interventions along the funnel**
* Identify prospects
    - Purchase "student lists"
* Recruit prospects remotely
    * Email, mail, text, etc.
* Recruit prospects in-person
    * **Off-campus recruiting visits** (e.g., high
school visits, fairs)
    * Campus visits
    * Other "outreach"
* Solicit inquiries, stealth applicants
    * Social media, advertising
* Convert admits to enrollees
    * Financial aid leveraging

# Literature review
## Scholarship on the enrollment funnel



Most research analyzes admissions `r cite(bib['RN3522'])` or financial aid `r cite(bib['RN1948'])`
- Final stages of enrollment funnel

Scholarship on recruiting is sparse

- Audits of university response to inquiries `r cite(bib[c('RN4331','RN4360')])`
- Off-campus recruiting visits
    - From the college perspective `r citep(bib['RN3519'])`
        - Important for relationships with prospects, counselors at "feeder" schools
    - From the perspective of high school students `r citep(bib['RN4324'])`
        - Which universities visit affects student decisions; especially first-gen, students of color

<br>
Research gap
- We don't know which universities visit which schools and communities
- If poor students, communities of color are not being recruited, then "under-matching" may be due to under-recruiting rather than lack of guidance

---

# Theoretical motivation
## Enrollment priorities and recruiting behavior

Organizational theory

- Contingency theory `r citep(bib['RN531'])`
    - Technical level vs. managerial level
- "New" institutional theory `r citep(bib['RN513'])`
    - Publicly adopt goals demanded by environment
    - Technical level cannot pursue all goals
        - Substantively adopt some goals (technical level)
        - Symbolically adopt others (policies, rhetoric)

<br>
Application to enrollment management (EM)

- "Iron triangle" of EM highlights three broad enrollment goals: **access, academic profile, revenue**
    - Resources scarce; depending on priorities, some goals receive more resources than others
- Enrollment priorities cannot be discerned by policies, rhetoric    
- Recruiting is allocation of resources from technical level
    - Knowing which populations targeted by recruiting interventions indicate enrollment priorities

# Research overview
## The broader off-campus recruiting research project

*** =left

**Data collection**

* Method
    - Web-scrape admissions websites
* Criteria to be included in data collection
    1. Post visits on admissions websites
    2. Organizational type
* Data collection sample
    - 54 public research universities
    - 49 private research universities
    - 42 selective private liberal arts
* Data collection period
    - 1/1/2017 to 12/31/2017
    - Ongoing data collection with larger sample

# Research overview
## Focus of this research paper

**Research question: what are the similarities and differences in off-campus recruiting patterns across public research universities?**
- Quantitative multiple case study of 15 public research universities

<br>
Why this research question: 
- First paper from the larger study
- Explore behavior inductively, rather than test specific hypotheses
- Subsequent papers more focused, thematic (e.g., racial red-lining, international recruiting)

<br>
Why focus on public research universities:
- Historic mission of social mobility for state residents
- Decline in state funding, growth in nonresident enrollment `r citep(bib['RN3753'])`
- What are they doing to get all these nonresidents? More effort recruiting nonresidents than residents?

# Research methods
## Defining events

**"Off-campus recruiting events" defined as off-campus events hosted by paid staff/consultants focused on soliciting applications**

<br>
- Event type
    - Include: college fairs, high school visits, community college visits,
counselor events
    - Exclude: admitted or committed student events, interviews
- Event host
    - Include: paid admissions staff or consultants (e.g. regional recruiters)
    - Exclude: alumni, student volunteers
- Event location
    - Any off-campus location
    - e.g., high school, community college, hotel, convention center, cafe, etc.

--- 

# Research methods
## Data collection, data processing, data quality

Data collection
- University website checked four times per year by two staff for URLs with recruiting events
- Web-scraping scripts run once per week

Data processing
- "Parsing": transform HTML text into tabular data
- "Geocoding": use Google Maps API to obtain detailed location data based on limited data
- Merge recruiting data to secondary data (e.g., schools, communities)

Data quality (are these data any good?)
- Concern 1: are scraped events properly classified and merged to secondary data?
    - Solution: manually check each scraped event
        - 8 of 15 universities checked thus far
- Concern 2: are all events posted on admissions website?
    - Solution: issue public records requests for all off-campus recruiting events
        - Received data from 7 of 15 universities; not yet incorporated

# Research methods
## Secondary data

Secondary data Sources:

- NCES Common Core of Data (public high schools)
- NCES Private School University Survey (private high schools)
- U.S. Census American Community Survey (community characteristics)
- IPEDS (community colleges)
- EdFacts Initiative (public high school academic achievement)
- Equality of Opportunity Project (university income
distributions)

# Research methods
## Research design for analyses

Quantitative multiple case study design
- "Quantitative case study" uses quantitative data as sole source of evidence `r citep(bib['RN4545'])`
- "Within-case" analyses of recruiting patterns
    - Situate within local context; national overview; "deep dive" of in-state and out-of-state patterns
    - Simple descriptive statistics (e.g., counts), static visualizations, interactive maps
- "Cross-case" analyses
    - Descriptive statistics and qualitative coding methods

<br>
Comparison to alternative research designs
- Large-N, random sample design
    - Not possible because recruiting data unavailable for random sample
    - Not desirable for present research because large-N designs pool results across cases
- Qualitative case study (usually collect data from multiple sources)
    - Our design is narrowly focused, systematic analysis of particular phenomena
    - Unlike `r citet(bib['RN3519'])`, we do not develop a holistic understanding of recruiting behavior

--- .table

# Research methods
## Analysis sample

Analysis sample consists of 15 public research universities
- Chosen from larger data collection sample (N=54) based on "completeness" of recruiting event data
- Subsequent drafts may reduce sample size based on principles of purposeful sampling `r citep(bib['RN4549'])`

# Summary
## Summary of results and next steps for this paper

Summary of results
- Majority of universities in our sample hosted twice as many out-of-state events as in-state events
    - Out-of-state events focus on affluent public schools and private schools
- Several universities focus more on in-state recruiting (e.g., U. Nebraska, North Carolina State)
- In-state visits tend to show little evidence of income or racial bias
- Some universities (e.g., Rutgers) show income/racial bias even in in-state visits
    - Must investigate whether bias persists after controlling for academic achievement, etc.

<br>
Next steps
- Complete data quality checks (e.g., incorporate data from public records requests) 
- Conduct "deep dive" for all universities
- Compare results across universities
    - Quantitative descriptive analyses; qualitative coding
- Develop broad categories of recruiting "types" and categorize universities

---

# Future research
## Using "data science" and public records requests to study recruiting


Off-campus recruiting project
- Expand data collection (e.g., regional public universities); publicly release all data
- Develop manuscripts with more narrow focus (e.g., nexus between state/local politics and visits)

Student list project (collected pilot data)
- Which student characteristics do universities prioritize when purchasing prospect lists from College Board/ACT?
- Data collection: Public records requests

Experimental audits of university responses to "inquiries" (pre-pilot stage)
- More favorable response to inquiries with certain characteristics (e.g., affluence of zip-code/school, evidence of third-party grant/loan)?
- Data collection: Automate emails; auto-fill "inquiry forms"

<br>
Impact goals
- Change national policy discourse on access inequality
- Empower local actors to hold universities accountable for access commitments (example <a href='./assets/other/colorado_letter.pdf' target='_blank'>HERE</a>)
    - Unless we document enrollment management behavior, we invite symbolic responses
